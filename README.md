# change_colour_extension
An extension that allows the user to change the background color of the currently focused page.

## Getting started

Extensions are made of different, but cohesive, components. Components can include background scripts, content scripts, an options page, UI elements and various logic files. Extension components are created with web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An extension's components will depend on its functionality and may not require every option.

This tutorial will build an extension that allows the user to change the background color of the currently focused page. It will use many of the extension platform's components to give an introductory demonstration of their relationships.
